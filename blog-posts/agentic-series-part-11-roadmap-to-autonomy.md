## The 24/7 Hosting Trap

Most AI agents are deployed on dedicated VPS instances. This means you pay for compute 100% of the time, even when the agent is idle. For an autonomous engineering system, this is extremely inefficient. You're effectively paying a "waiting tax" for 23 hours a day.

In an **Agentic Ready** architecture, we don't host a persistent agent; we host a **Gateway** that triggers compute only when a pulse is detected.

## Scale-to-Zero Architecture

By leveraging **AWS Lambda** as the primary entry point and **AWS Fargate** on-demand for the reasoning engine, we achieve a true "Scale-to-Zero" state. When your agent isn't working, your infrastructure cost is essentially zero. This makes autonomous engineering not just a tool for the elite, but a standard for every developer.

```json
{
  "compute": "Lambda (Gateway) + Fargate (On-Demand)",
  "storage": "DynamoDB (On-Demand) + S3 (Standard-IA)",
  "monthly_estimate": {
    "idle_cost": "$0.00",
    "active_cost_per_query": "$0.0004",
    "total_target": "$1.00 - $1.50"
  }
}
```

## The Blueprint for Autonomy

Achieving the $1/month target requires aggressive optimization. We use DynamoDB in on-demand mode for task state and S3 for long-term memory. The "spiky" nature of these services aligns perfectly with the intermittent bursts of an autonomous team.

> Autonomy shouldn't be expensive. It should be the most efficient way you have ever written code.
